# Hough_Transform
 Hough transform is a technique that can be used to isolate features of a particular shape
within an image. Because it requires that the desired features be specified in some
parametric form, the classical Hough transform is most commonly used for the detection of
regular curves such as lines, circles, ellipses, etc.

This Project mainly deals with Line Detection and was done as part of academic requirement for DIP LAB-2021, IIT Kharagpur.
